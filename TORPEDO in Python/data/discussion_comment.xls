Wouldn't it be better to open up domestic markets for agricultural products produced in the third world? And to stop hypocritical farm subsidies?

We can invest in future peace and national security by ensuring that people around the world have basic essentials such as food and clean water. We shouldn't spend so much of our resources on entering into armed conflicts around the world. While we claim we do to promote peace and help bring stability to regions, our actions have an air of Imperialism. We create enemies worldwide by the way we handle armed conflicts. Every conflict, however, has an underlying cause.

Is this a business model problem or a foreign policy, and what determines the USG's position on that question?

Withdrawal of these forces will ease the US economic burden while easing international tensions. Of course there will be small local wars and many countries will not opt for US-style democracy, but this is the natural order of things and nations will adapt on their own, as they always have.

At the same time both countries need to embrace free trade and abandon protectionism. I think that the US and China should work out bilateral trade agreements to this end. The last thing I would like to say is that American workers are less competitive abroad because they are hindered by the US government.

But the money spent on war could be used in the US for health care and education, two areas in which you seem to have some problems. Secondly, I don't agree with the desire America has to push European countries to fight in the wars Americans started when nobody asked them to. For centuries Europe has been a battleground for nations and civilisations. Now that we have finally managed to achieve some stability and good living conditions, we are not interested in sending our soldiers to war and provoke the terrorists.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2010-03-16 05:22:23</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>821</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1126</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>There will be several topics to discuss.

Often, the United States plays right into the disparity that exists, and allows the divide to widen even further.

Over the last 60 year they have proven in word and deed to be the most anti-semitic, untrustworthy group  out there.  The  &quot;Israeli state&quot; is currently perpetrating a Holocaust against the Palestinian people and is the most dangerous terrorist state with nuclear weapons in the world today and as such poses a threat to the US  and the world.  At this point, all US aid to Israel must halt .  Sanctions, boycotts and divestment should be ramped up until their nuclear arsenal is dismantled and their Apartheid ended.

We help restore the genius of their own culture, one that the world will respect. The diversity of the world's people must be defended, for only with understanding of the sovereignty of societies will the world find a balance of tolerance.

Power is being fragmented and diffused amongst a denser group of state and non-state actors who often have separate, competing agendas.  A host of &quot;global risks&quot; have arisen as challengers to foreign policy goals (terrorism, transnational crime, global warming, financial crises, mass migration, and global disease pandemics.) Global risks require a different diplomatic approach than traditional foreign policy issues because they are deterritorialized, unquantifiabe, and situated in the future.

Encouraging the brightest talents of Asia to work with their American counterparts and incorporate images of the America they experience into their work will help to counter negative stereotypes. Increasing the number of Americans who visit Asia and are fluent in Asian languages would also help to promote mutual understanding between the regions.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2010-03-18 07:13:38</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1292</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1837</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>The Israeli-Palestini conflict is probably the most difficult and intractable issue in our time and the two state solution, while not ensuring peace, presents the most plausable scenario for lasting stability in the region.

I would suggest that students at all grade levels learn some basics in ethical reasoning beyond simply obeying the laws and being a good citizen.  Sure, groups like the Boy Scouts teach a fair amount of this - but not ALL of our youth get this training, nor is it formally consistent. The federal government should respect the boundaries of separation between church and state - by teaching reasoning skills applicable to ethics and morality instead of dictating the &quot;rightness&quot; of a particular ethical system.

America needs to stop  imposing its viewpoint on the rest of the world and respect the soverenity of other nations. The hypocrisy that pervades American foreign policy is to glaring. America is seen as the big bully by many nations and as such helps to fuel hatred for its policies. I would suggest that America review how they approach foreign countries and maintain the respect factor in all dealings. America is not a perfect society and should therefore be more tolerant of other societies that are experiencing their own problems without interfering with them once they do not tow the American way of thinking.

It is embarassing enough for the federal government to practice discrimination, why must we allow it to pass abroad? Mrs. Clinton, you yourself ran for president on a platform of full equality for LGBT citizens. Please, place more realistic pressure with governments that practice official homophobia.

The traditional rentier theory also points out that resource rents promote authoritarianism notable due to the spending mechanism of the regime. Good governance literatures, on the other hand, indicate that corruption discourages investment because it acts like a tax and increase the cost of doing business. Sadly, African oil-producing countries are among the most corrupt in the world. Of the 163 countries ranked in 2006 by Transparency International, Algeria ranked 84th, Gabon 90th, Nigeria and Angola tied for 142nd, and Chad, 156th.

Every administration has been too fearful to take this step for fear of political backlash and we cannot continue to go this route. Take a firm stance and BE CONSISTENT; do not denounce the settlements and then meet with a lobbying group the next day, or we undermine any credibility or negotiating capital2.

There is always  a way to balance diplomacy  on the platform of military strength and defense---hence offense and defense.  Hillary Clinton is  the perfect person with the diplomatic skills to balance both offense and defense.Iran should have been punished by now for their defiance as well as North Korea for their attack on our ally.  There comes a time when you have to  step up and be the leader and punish the bullies and show them that their behavior  will cease and desist  we do so with our military action having the last word.We do this because they have done too much diplomantic game playing and it no longer is a viable tool.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2010-06-08 17:34:44</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2805</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>3804</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>Out of the five questions designed for this website, three pose solutions for foreign policy objectives in creative and non-violent ways (diplomacy, food production, and empowering women).
